# Diabetes Classification Using Artificial Neural Network

This project focuses on building and evaluating an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify whether a patient has diabetes or not, using medical data from the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.

The goal is to demonstrate how neural networks can be effectively applied to health-related binary classification problems, and to explore their performance in comparison to traditional approaches.

# Project Highlights
✅ Preprocessing of structured health data

✅ Feature scaling and data normalization

✅ Splitting data into training and test sets

✅ Building a simple feed-forward ANN using TensorFlow / Keras

✅ Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

✅ Visualization of training loss and accuracy over epochs

✅ Saving and loading the trained model using checkpoints

# Technologies Used
